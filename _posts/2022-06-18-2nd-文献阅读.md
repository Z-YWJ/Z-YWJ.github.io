> Title: Biologically informed deep neural network for prostate cancer discovery

### **Summary**

**P-NET, a biologically informed deep neural network, can accurately classified castration-resistant metastatic versus primary prostate cancers and evaluate molecular drivers of treatment resistance through complete model interpretability.**

Based on whole Reactome dataset, the authors design a sparse neural network of five layers. The input layer is features representing mutations,copy number amplification and copy number deletions. The second layer represents a set of genes of interest. The higher layers represent a hierarchy of pathways and biological processes.

![PNET](../../../../Files/pnet-model.png)

The second and third layers is restricted to have connections reflecting the gene-pathway or real parent–child relationships by the Reactome pathway dataset. The connections are encoded by a mask matrix $M$ that is multiplied by the weights matrix $W$ to **zero-out all the connections that do not exist in the Reactome pathway dataset**, which make model sparse.

The output of each layer is calculated as $y = f[(M *W)^T x +b]$, where $f$ is tanh —— the activation function, $M$ is the mask matrix, $W$ is the weights matrix, $x$ is the input matrix, $b$ is the bias vector.

To allow each layer to be useful by itself, authors added a predictive layer with sigmoid activation after each hidden layer. The final prediction of the network was calculated by taking the average of all the layer outcomes.The model was trained using Adam optimizer to reduce the binary cross-entropy loss functions.

**Interpretability**: Used the DeepLIFT attribution method, P-NET can provide a relative ranking of nodes in each layer to inform generation of biological hypotheses.

### **Comment**

Designing DNN architectures isn't an easy task, but in this paper, based on biological knowledge —— the parent–child relationship of genes, pathways and biological processes,
the authors designed an interpretable model in which different biological entities were encoded into neural network language.

In this way, not only makes the model sparse and easy to train,
but also increases the interpretability of the model, which is always of great significance in medicine.

## Review

> Current and future perspectives of liquid biopsies in genomics-driven oncology

### **Liquid biopsies**

* non-invasive, minimally invasive —— sampling and analysis of analytes from various biological fluids, mostly blood  
* circulating tumour cells (CTCs), **circulating tumour DNA, ctDNA**166bp, circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA), circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), tumour-educated platelets (TEPs), proteins and metabolites
* **genomic mutations and copy number alterations**, but now increasingly use information from the transcriptome, the epigenome, the proteome and the metabolome

three criteria of a tumour biomarker:  

* analytical validity: the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of a test
* clinical validity: assesses the ability of a test to divide a population into separate groups with significantly different clinical outcomes
* clinical utility: evaluates whether outcomes are improved for patients who received the test compared with those who did not

Actual progress in clinical practice —— two FDA-approved cfDNA-based tests:

* cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 -- detects EGFR mutations in plasma cfDNA(lung cancer) 
* Epi proColon -- detectt methylation status of the SEPT9 promoter in plasma cfDNA(CRC)
they together emphasize the potential of ctDNA as a biomarker

### **Evaluating ctDNA as a biomarker**

precision oncology:

* predict: ctDNA can provide a comprehensive view of the tumor genome, assess intratumor heterogeneity, detect subclonal mutations(deep seqencing of genomic region spanning thousands of bases), and may transmit information about tumor mass(linear relationship between tumor volume and variant allele frequency, correlation between pretreatment ctDNA concentration and metabolic tumor volume)

* prognostic: powerful prognostic marker associated with recurrence and poor outcome in patients with colon, ovarian and lung cancer

* detection of drug resistance markers

challenge：

* ctDNA level is low in plasma, and may vary greatly between patients  

> increase detectable moleculars(not clinically feasible)
> simultaneously detect more mutations(yep)  
> Recent developments focused on increasing the analytical sensitivity of sequencing approaches: unique molecular identifiers(UMIs, molecular barcodes), CAPP-Seq, TEC-Seq

* Mutations of aging cells will cause false-positive in cfDNA testing. 

### **Other liquid biopsy analytics**

1. DNA methylation patterns

> can map the tissue of origin of cfDNA or detect cancer. 
> 
> **occur early**: two studies recently suggested tumour-specific methylation changes may be detectable with a lead time to clinical diagnosis of **2 years** in breast and ovarian cancer
> 
> In practical, it most extensively used with cfDNA

2. Mapping nucleosome positions

> generate maps of nucleosome occupancy -- track cfDNA tissues of origin

3. MicroRNA signatures

> **surprisingly stable in plasum** (contained in EVs)
> 
> example: 13 miRNAs had a sensitivity and negative predictive value comparable to LDCT alone and may therefore be suitable for lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals

4. Extracellular vesicles(EVs)

> up to 100 proteins and ~10kb of nucleotides can be packed exosome. It comprise miRNA (40.4%), piwi-interacting RNA (40%), pseudo-genes (3.7%), lncRNA (2.4%), tRNA (2.1%) and mRNA (2.1%)
> 
> EVs may contribute to elucidating the origin of cancer, early detection and establishing the prognosis of patients with different cancers
>
> <u>exosomes arise from viable cancer cells</u>

5. Tumour-educated platelets

> Tumour cells may transfer tumour-associated biomolecules to platelets, a process referred to as ‘education’
>
> 84–96% accuracy -- discriminate patientsm from healthy individuals
>
> 71% accuracy -- establish the organ of origin of the primary tumour
>
> can predict types of cancer -- different molecular tumour subtypes were associated with different platelet profiles

6. Proteins

> for most proteins, ~~information about tissue specificity or cancer specificity~~ is largely missing
> 
> **combination with other analytes** may substantially improved liquid-biopsy-based detection of early-stage cancer

7. Metabolites

> cancer cells seem to have almost unlimited options to rewire their metabolic pathways

8. CTCs

> detection indicators: enumeration of CTCs -> analysis of the genomes, transcriptomes, proteins and epigenomes by single-cell analysis
> 
> viable CTCs are relevant for forming metastases(apoptotic not)
>  
> the main current user of CTC-derived explants (CDXs): preclinical drug development

### **Future challenges for liquid biopsies**

- composition of analytes in the peripheral blood is different between health adult and aging people, more [details](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0071-5/figures/3)

- interplay between liquid biopsy components and anticancer immunity? a new and challenging area

- further improvements to diagnostic tools are required to enable the detection of small amounts of tumour-derived components in the circulation
